# PnPTweaks
A mod for BGEE and BG2EE

v1.01

This mod has five optional components:

1) PnP Healing Spells
   This component changes all healing spells and their opposites 
   (Cause Serious/Critical Wounds) to heal their 2e ADnD amount.
   
   Cure Light Wounds: 1d8   
   Cure Medium Wounds: 1d10+1   
   Cure Serious Wounds: 2d8+1   
   Cause Serious Wounds: 2d8+1   
   Cure Critical Wounds: 3d8+3   
   Cause Critical Wounds: 3d8+3

2) PnP Healing Potions
   This component changes Potion of Healing and Potion of Extra
   Healing to heal for their 2e ADnD amount.

   Potion of Healing: 2d4+2   
   Potion of Extra Healing: 3d8+3
   
3) Increase Raise Dead cost at temples
   This component changes the gold cost of a Raise Dead spell in 
   all temples to 800 + 200 per level.
   
   Level 1: 1000   
   Level 2: 1200   
   Level 3: 1400   
   Level 4: 1600   
   Level 5: 1800   
   ...

4) PnP Identify
   This component aims to make identifying magic items more of a
   hassle, as it is in 2e ADnD. It is impossible to implement the
   exact way the Identify works, but I tried to approximate.

   New spell description:
   
   "Identify
   (Divination)

   Level: 1   
   Range: 0   
   Duration: 2 rounds   
   Casting Time: 9   
   Area of Effect: The caster   
   Saving Throw: None

   When this spell is cast, it increases the caster's lore by 
   20 +5 per level for 2 rounds. Since the spell is extremely 
   exhausting, the caster loses 8 points of constitution which 
   are regained gradually over the course of 16 hours. If this 
   spell drops the caster's constitution below 1, they will die. 
   Exceptionally tough casters can use this spell twice in order 
   to double the effect."

   This means, it is no longer possible to identify items via the 
   identify button on the item. Unfortunately I have not been 
   able to make this spell castable from scroll. So if you find
   an Identify scroll, you can only use it to learn the spell.

5) Increase identify cost in stores
   This component has three options:
   - double the cost
   - triple the cost
   - quintuple the cost
